# Car_Price_Prediction_Model
The Car Price Prediction Model uses machine learning to predict the selling price of a car based on features like model, year, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and more. Built using Python's scikit-learn and a Linear Regression model, it provides accurate predictions based on historical car data.
