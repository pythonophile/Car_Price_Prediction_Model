# Car Price Prediction Model

This project is a car price prediction model that uses machine learning to predict the price of a car based on various features such as the car's make, model, year of manufacturing, mileage, fuel type, and other relevant attributes. The model was trained using a dataset of car listings, and it leverages regression techniques to make predictions.

# Project Overview
The Car Price Prediction Model is designed to assist car buyers and sellers in estimating the market value of a car based on its attributes. The primary goal is to predict a car’s selling price by training a machine learning model on historical car data. This can be especially useful for sellers wanting to list their vehicles at competitive prices and for buyers looking to estimate the fair price of a used car.

The model was built using the scikit-learn library in Python, utilizing a Linear Regression approach, which is effective for predicting continuous values like car prices.

#  Dataset
The dataset used for training the model contains several thousand records of car listings, with features such as:

Name: The car model name
Year: The year of manufacture
KM Driven: The distance the car has traveled (in kilometers)
Fuel Type: Type of fuel the car uses (Petrol, Diesel, CNG, etc.)
Seller Type: Whether the seller is an individual or a dealer
Transmission: Type of transmission (Manual or Automatic)
Owner Type: How many previous owners the car had
Mileage: Mileage in kmpl (kilometers per liter)
Engine: Engine size (in CC)
Max Power: Maximum power of the car’s engine (in BHP)
Seats: Number of seats in the car
Selling Price: The actual price of the car (target variable)

# Features
The following features were used as inputs to predict the price of a car:

Car Model (Name)
Year of Manufacture
Kilometers Driven
Fuel Type
Seller Type
Transmission Type
Number of Previous Owners
Mileage
Engine Capacity
Maximum Power
Number of Seats
The target variable is the Selling Price.

# Modeling
We used a Linear Regression model from the scikit-learn library to predict the car prices. The process involved the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling the data.
Train-Test Split: Dividing the dataset into a training set and a test set to evaluate the model’s performance.
Model Training: Training the Linear Regression model on the training dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) on the test set.
Requirements
To run this project, you’ll need the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
streamlit (if deploying with Streamlit)
matplotlib (for visualization, optional)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction.git
cd car-price-prediction
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset (if not included in the repository) and place it in the project directory.

Usage
Train the model: You can train the model by running the provided script:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
This script will:

Load and preprocess the data.
Train a Linear Regression model.
Save the trained model to disk using pickle.
Make Predictions: You can predict the price of a car by providing input features. For example:

python
Copy code
import pickle
import numpy as np

# Load the trained model
with open('car_price_model.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    model = pickle.load(file)

# Define input features
input_data = np.array([[0, 'Car Model', 2015, 50000, 'Petrol', 'Dealer', 'Manual', 'First Owner', 18.0, 1500, 120, 5]])

# Make a prediction
predicted_price = model.predict(input_data)
print(f"Predicted Car Price: {predicted_price}")
Streamlit Deployment: You can deploy the model with a user-friendly interface using Streamlit. Run the following command to start the app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This will open a web-based interface where users can input car details and get price predictions.

Results
After training and evaluating the model, the following metrics were achieved:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): XX.XX
R-Squared (R²): XX.XX
These results indicate how well the model predicts car prices. You can experiment with different models and feature sets to improve performance.
